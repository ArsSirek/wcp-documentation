description: Step by step guide to park a domain with wildcardparking.com

# Get Started

To quickly get started with our system you need to 

1. Register on the site [wildcardparking.com](https://wildcardparking.com/user/register)
2. Park a domain \(the quickest way would be with an A record, as NS records changes usually take hours to have an effect\)
3. Done. Now you should be able to see one of our pre-installed templates on you domain and be able to play with the settings on [templates page](https://wildcardparking.com/my/templates).
